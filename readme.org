* Weather Station

This is an Elixir [[https://www.nerves-project.org/][Nerves]] project running on a Raspberry Pi. It is from the book [[https://pragprog.com/titles/passweather/build-a-weather-station-with-elixir-and-nerves/][Build a Weather Station with Elixir and Nerves:
Visualize Your Sensor Data with Phoenix and Grafana]], by Alexander Koutmos, Bruce A. Tate, and Frank Hunleth.

The Pi collects data via sensors and POSTs it to a [[https://www.phoenixframework.org/][Phoenix]] server. Data is visualized with [[https://grafana.com/][Grafana]].

#+begin_src sh
# docker
cd weather_tracker
docker-compose up # visit localhost:3000 admin/admin

# phoenix (separate terminal)
cd weather_tracker
mix phx.server # API on localhost:4000

# to inspect/debug the device
ssh hub.local
RingLogger.attach()
exit()
#+end_src

The devices I have are slightly different from the ones used in the book:

| device               | mine     | book     |
|----------------------+----------+----------|
| ambient light sensor | VCNL4040 | VEML6030 |
| atmospheric sensor   | BME280   | BME680   |
| air quality          | CCS811   | SGP30    |

** Interfacing with the Pi

Getting values from sensors:

#+begin_src sh
ssh hub.local

VCNL4040.start_link()
VCNL4040.get_measurement()

alias SensorHub.Sensor
gas = Sensor.new(Ccs811)
environment = Sensor.new(BMP280)
Sensor.measure(gas)
Sensor.measure(environment)
#+end_src

Update the Pi:

#+begin_src sh
export MIX_TARGET=rpi4
cd sensor_hub
mix deps.get
mix firmware
mix upload hub.local

mix burn # for when it's hard-wired, not ssh
#+end_src
